# Rao-Blackwellized-CME-solver

This software contains a new algorithm that applies Rao-Blackwell method to solving chemical reaction networks. 
A paper describing the details of this algorithm will come out soon. 

Software requirement:
Matlab 2021a or newer versions

Required tool boxes:
Simulink
Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
Parallel Computing Toolbox 

CME_solvers.m:
This script computes the CME of different chemical reaction networks. 

filter_for_SCRN.m:
This script solves the stochastic filtering problems. 

Folder--Networks:
This folder contains several chemical reaction networks.
